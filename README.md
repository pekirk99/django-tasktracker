# Task Tracker Application with Django

Welcome to the **Task Tracker** repository! This project demonstrates how to create a simple web application using Django. The application allows users to:
- View a list of tasks.
- Add new tasks.
- Track the completion status of tasks.

This repository is beginner-friendly and focuses on Djangoâ€™s core features like models, views, templates, URL routing, and database migrations.

## What Is Django?

**Django** is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is ideal for developers who want to build scalable, secure, and maintainable web applications.

### Why Use Django?
- **Rapid Development**: Built-in tools reduce repetitive coding tasks.
- **Security**: Prevents common vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
- **Scalability**: Handles small to large-scale projects.
- **Built-in Admin Interface**: Simplifies database management.

### Why Not Use Django?
- **Learning Curve**: Can be overwhelming for new developers.
- **Overhead**: Might be too heavy for simple projects.
- **Real-Time Support**: Requires extra setup for WebSocket-based applications.

## Features

- Add tasks with a title.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- View all tasks dynamically rendered on a webpage.
- Admin interface to manage tasks.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional) and install Django using `pip`.

### Step 3: Start the Django Project

Set up the project by creating the main project directory and initializing an app for task tracking.

---

## Key Steps in Building the Application

### 1. Define the Model

Create a model to represent the tasks, including fields for the task title and its completion status. Migrate the model to create the database table.

### 2. Configure Views and Templates

Implement views to display a list of tasks and handle adding new tasks. Create templates to render these views dynamically on the frontend.

### 3. Configure URLs

Set up URL routing to map user actions (like viewing tasks or adding a task) to the appropriate views.

### 4. Run the Server

Start the Django development server to view and interact with the task tracker in your browser.

## How to Migrate and Troubleshoot

1. **Check Migrations**:
   Use the `makemigrations` command to ensure Django detects model changes and creates migration files.

2. **Apply Migrations**:
   Use the `migrate` command to apply the migrations and create database tables.

3. **Verify Table Exists**:
   Use the database shell to confirm the creation of the `tasks_task` table.

4. **Reset Migrations (if necessary)**:
   If migrations fail:
   - Delete existing migration files (except `__init__.py`).
   - Recreate and apply migrations using `makemigrations` and `migrate`.

5. **Restart the Server**:
   Restart the Django development server to ensure changes take effect.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Models**: Define the structure of the database.
- **Views**: Implement the applicationâ€™s logic.
- **Templates**: Render dynamic content for the frontend.
- **Admin Interface**: Manage tasks directly through Djangoâ€™s admin panel.
- **URL Routing**: Link user requests to application logic.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication for personalized task lists.
- Allow users to mark tasks as completed directly from the task list.
- Implement real-time updates using WebSockets.
